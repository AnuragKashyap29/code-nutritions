            <p>
              With over 15 years in nutritional biochemistry and a PhD from Stanford, I've dedicated my career to
              identifying supplements that actually work. Every product in our collection has been personally vetted for
              efficacy, purity, and bioavailability.
            </p>

            <p>
              We don't just look at labelsâ€”we examine manufacturing processes, review third-party testing, and analyze
              the research. If it doesn't meet our standards, it doesn't make the cut.
